BDD framework
-------------

It is a framework designed for working with Agile environments.

TDD approach : Kent Beck while with eXtreme Programming.

Kent Beck + Eric Gama --> Junit API is designed to automate the unit testing process in par with Agile practices.

Agile Model : XP, SCRUM, Kanban, Crystal, sAFe etc.

Customized models that follows the Agile practice.

Iterative and Incremental approach to develop a product.

Conventional models Vs Agile Models.

The Agile models will follow the fixed duration / iteration approach
Every iteration will have the working software delivered.

12 principle of Agile
Agile Manifesto

Refer : https://agilemanifesto.org/

PO(Business Representative) + SCRUM Team + SCRUM Master(Mentor / facilitator)

PO(Business Representative) : Collate the information to be developed ans articulate a document Product Backlog : Collection of user stories ( THe requiements to be developed will be written from end user direction. template / format) & Ranking / prioritization of user stories based on its importance.

As a <<user>>, I want to <<Action>>, so that <<Goal>>

Citi bank --> Bank Manager, Bank associate, Customer <<Salary , Current etc.>>

SCRUM Team : Development team : Designer + Developer + Tester : 7+/-2 

SCRUM approach : Iterative and incremental

Every iteration in SCRUM is called as SPRINT : it is a fixed duration. 2-4 weeks.

2 weeks : 14 calendar days

4 non working days ( 2 sat & 2 sun) : 10 Days 

Day 1 : Sprint Planning meeting : 3-4 hours : Whole team (PO + SCRUM Team  SCRUm Master) : SCRUM team will select the prioritized user story will seek the explanation or elloborate the requirements further.

PO is expected to answer / clarify the requirements that are asked by the SCRUM team.

SCRUM will start estimating the size of the story ( HIGH, Moderate, Low) and task planning , Risk involved, are there any dependencies, any constraints
How big is this user story can this be developed in SPRINT?

Once they decide to develop they will add the user story to a SPRINT Backlog

# velocity : Size of Sprint backlog : # of user stories to be developed within a SPRINT.


Day 2 - Day 13 : Product development ; 8 days : SCRUm team to develop the product, : Designing _ Coding _ Testing will be done every day.

Daily stand - up call : Whole team

Every day there is a development and every day there will be testing.
Developer and tester are day before and day behind.

CICD : Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment --> Continuous Testing

CICD : Automated approach of integrating, deploying and testing the build everyday.


Day 14 : Sprint Review & Sprint Reterospection

 Sprint Review : Performed by PO. To check what is agreed on SPRINT plan meeting is developed or not.

Execute what is developed and approve / reject the product.


In conventional models,

Requirements gathered --> Designing --> (coding --> Unit Testing) --> Testing --> UAT --> Deployment --> Release

Development Plan is different from Testing Plan.

TDD : Test Driven Development / Test-First approach : XP

What is the test plan so that the developments can be done accordingly.

Testing first before developement.

<<----------------------- RED Cycle--------------------------------------->
User stories --> Unit Test cases --> Unit Test Methods(Junit API) --> Execute --> Failed --> Write code --> Execute --> Passed --> Optimization
-------------<-------- GREEN CYCLE--------------->

Dev+QA+PO --> Common idealogy 

redefined the TDD approach to an ATDD approach

Acceptance Test Driven Development:

user stories --> acceptance criteria --> Unit test methods --> executed --> Test failed --> Coding(develop the feature) --> Executed --> Test passed --> Optimizations.


Behaviour Driven Development : Tester to check the behaviour of the product based on the acceptance criteria

user stories --> acceptance criteria --> test methods --> executed --> Coding ( Test the feature) --> Executed --> Test Passed


What is acceptance criteria? It is a testable requirement derived from the user stories.

Acceptance Criteria is written in a readable format are step by step instruction that repeats user requirements for positive and negative test conditions.

Acceptance Criteria is written using GHERKINS, Given when then format.

Acceptance criteria is written to cover the functional and non functional requirements of the product under developments.

Acceptance criteria should be written by the PO / QA
If written by QA it should reviewed and approved by the PO.

Acceptance Criteria is commonly used by the developer for development, Tester for testing and PO for UAT.
-----------------------------------------------

BDD framework : It is an automated approach to test the product based on acceptance criteria.

1. Write the acceptance criteria : Features : GHERKINS
2. Create the step definition : Test code : Cucumber + Selenium
3. Execute the feature againt the code : Junit + TestNG + Cucumber.
